### BrainStormer - SenchaCON 2013 Hackathon Meeting Notes App!
=============

### Overview
Built in 3 days (and 3 nights pretty much non-stop) for the SenchaCON 2013 Hackathon, BrainStormer is a whiteboard meeting app that lets you

### Features

* Take pictures of your whiteboards
* Take notes and write detailed narratives
* Share your meeting notes (pictures + narratives) with others by email

### Platforms Supported

* Android
* BB10
* iOS (Not extensively tested, the Android branch code works for Note saving, editing, deleting & Camera part - email part won't work)

There are separate branches for Android and BB10 as I was forced to use Cordova 3.0 for the latter - it just won't run with 2.9 that I used for Android
