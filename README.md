Built in 3 days (and 3 nights pretty much non-stop) for the SenchaCON 2013 Hackathon, BrainStormer is a whiteboard meeting app that lets you

'Take pictures of your whiteboards
'Take notes and write detailed narratives
'Share your meeting notes (pictures + narratives) with others by email
''More than anything else, BrainStormer represents the true spirit of SenchaCON 2013 - "Serious App Dev, Serious App Fun!"
